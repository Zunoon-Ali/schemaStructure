Great, you're almost there! Let me explain it **clearly and practically** — with real-world examples — so you fully understand:

### 🎯 What is `dist`?

`dist` = **Course-wise component distribution** (like the rulebook for teachers).

It tells:
➡️ “In this course, how many marks are allocated to each component?”

| Course | Component  | Max Marks |
| ------ | ---------- | --------- |
| DB     | Assignment | 10        |
| DB     | Mid        | 30        |
| DB     | Final      | 60        |

✅ So this data goes in the `dist` table.

#### Example from `dist` table:

| `id` | `hid` (component) | `total` (max marks) | `rid` (recap/course) |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1    | 1 (Mid)           | 30                  | 1 (DB course)        |
| 2    | 2 (Final)         | 60                  | 1                    |
| 3    | 3 (Assignment)    | 10                  | 1                    |

> Think of `dist` as the **blueprint**: how much weight each part carries in the course.

### 🎯 What is `cdist`?

`cdist` = **Customized distribution for specific courses**
➡️ Used when a specific course or teacher **doesn’t follow the default** in `dist`.

#### Example:

Say "AI course" normally has:

| Component  | Default |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Mid        | 30      |
| Final      | 60      |
| Assignment | 10      |

But a teacher wants:

| Component | Custom |
| --------- | ------ |
| Mid       | 40     |
| Final     | 50     |

✅ That goes in the `cdist` table.

#### Example from `cdist`:

| `id` | `hid` (component) | `total` | `rid` (recap) |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| 1    | 1 (Mid)           | 40      | 2 (AI course) |
| 2    | 2 (Final)         | 50      | 2             |

---

### 🔁 Relationship between them:

| Use Case                           | Use `dist`? | Use `cdist`? |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Course follows normal distribution | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No         |
| Course has a special scheme        | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes        |

---

### 🔥 Real-Life Analogy

* **`dist`** = default exam structure: Mid = 30, Final = 60, Assignment = 10
  (like the school policy)

* **`cdist`** = teacher says: “Nope, in **my** class, mid is 40 and final is 50”
  (custom for that course only)

---

### ✅ What they are NOT:

* ❌ `dist` is not actual student marks
* ❌ `cdist` is not what students scored
* ✅ **They define the full marks (maximum)** — so we know how to calculate percentages

Student actual marks go in:

* `marks` → default marking
* `cmarks` → if course uses `cdist`, marks go here

### 🧠 Summary:

| Table    | Stores...                               | Connected with...          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `dist`   | Max marks per component (default)       | `marks`, `head`, `recap`   |
| `cdist`  | Max marks per component (custom course) | `cmarks`, `head`, `recap`  |
| `marks`  | Actual student marks (if `dist` used)   | `student`, `recap`, `head` |
| `cmarks` | Actual student marks (if `cdist` used)  | `student`, `recap`, `head` |
